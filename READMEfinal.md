Overview
This project explores the famous Titanic passenger dataset to predict passenger survival outcomes.
Using Python and machine learning techniques, we clean and process the data, visualize important patterns, conduct statistical analysis, and train a predictive model with a Decision Tree Classifier.

Libraries Used
NumPy — Mathematical operations and array support

Pandas — Data loading, cleaning, and manipulation

SciPy — Statistical testing (T-test on passenger ages)

Matplotlib — Basic graph plotting

Seaborn — Advanced data visualizations

Scikit-learn — Machine learning modeling and evaluation
